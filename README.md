# Wiki-Blog-Web-Design
### Content Marketing
## Aim
The aim was to design a content-focused web page that transforms complex banking data into simple, helpful articles and blog content. The goal was to make financial insights more accessible to everyday readers through thoughtful layout, visuals, and storytelling.

## Web Design Approach
Using insights from banking analysis, the website was designed like a digital blog magazine. Each section told a story—from spending trends to loan struggles—crafted into articles and news-style content. The layout included clean navigation, article blocks, headlines, and sections for tips and commentary.

## Tools Used
- Web design layout (HTML or WordPress)
- Canva/Figma for visuals and banners
- Google tools for SEO and keyword research
- Subscriber sign-up and comment section for engagement
  
##Visual Theme
The site used a soft, readable color scheme:

- Blue for structure and calm tone
- Green for success and savings themes
- Orange for attention and challenge topics
- Fonts were kept light and modern with plenty of spacing to avoid clutter.

## Features
- Blog-style article sections based on financial insights
- SEO-optimized headings and tags
- Email subscription form
- Comment box for user interaction
- Ad slots placed subtly between content

## Limitations
- No backend automation yet for CRM or personalized content
- Layout may need adjustments for full responsiveness across devices
